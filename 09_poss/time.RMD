# "If You Want to Kick then Do Karate!"

Ball possession is king in rugby sevens. Tactically kicking away possession in order to improve field position is a common rugby 15s tactic rarely seen in sevens. Gordon Tietjens summarized the prevailing attitude toward kicking in rugby sevens when he said "If you want to kick then do karate." It is hard to imagine a 15s coach saying the same thing. Sevens teams will often run the ball from deep inside their own 22, passing the ball through or around their own goal posts, rather than kick the ball away.

Conversely, there are sevens techniques that intentionally lose ground -- such as the pull out and pocket pass -- in order to avoid a tackle and the subsequent contest for possession. These techniques are rarely seen in rugby 15s.

The tactical differences between sevens and fifteens are based on the assumption that in sevens the best defense is a good offense, hence the reluctance to kick away possession and the willingness to sacrifice field position in order to hold onto the ball. Winning sevens teams often attribute their success starving their opponents of possession.

However, recent possession statistics challenge the conventional wisdom about ball possession. Figure 1 plots average time of possession for all core teams during the 2014-2015 World Sevens Series.

The teams are plotted from left to right on the X-axis by overall series order of finish. Fiji finished first overall. South Africa finished second, and so on. The Y-axis plots each teams' average time of possesion in seconds over the course of the series. 

The horizontal dashed line marks the overall series average of

If we subscribe to the conventional wisdom about ball possession in rugby sevens we would be safe to assume that the highest finishers also dominated time of possession. The overall series average was XYZ ... about three minutes. New Zealand (NZL) and Scotland (SCO) had the highest averages but finished third and seventh on the overall standings. Fiji (FIJ) and South Africa (RSA) -- the top two series finishers -- had less time of possession than the series average. FIJ finished first overall but had the lowest average of all core teams.

Based on this data there is no obvious relationship between average time of possession and winning. Some of the high finishers had less possession than the series average. Some of the low finishers had more.

This raises the question -- is ball possession an important factor for winning in rugby 7s?

The remainder of this post examines the relationship between winning and possession in rugby sevens using match statistics from the 2014-2015 World Rugby Sevens Series.

## Possession and scoring

One way possession might be related to winning is that more possession equals more points. After all, you need the ball to score trys.

Figure 2 plots the relationship between time of possession on the x axis and scoring on the y. There were 405 total matches in the 2014-2015 series. The graph plots possession and scoring for every team in every match for 810 total data points. Some jitter was added to the individual data points to improve visibility.

The vertical red line shows the series average time of possession. The horizontal blue line shows the series scoring average. The lines divide the graph into four quadrants. Matches with above average possession and scoring are in the upper right qudrant. Matches with below average possession and scoring are in the lower left quadrant, and so on.

According to these averages, in a typical match a team has scores about three trys in three minutes of possession.

A positive correlation between time of possession and scoring would mean they increase together. More possession would result in more scoring. On the graph the data points would trend upward as they move right.

This graph does not show a positive correlation. Instead the points are spread nearly evenly across all 4 qudrants. Possession does not guarantee scoring. More than thirty teams had more than 3 minutes of ball possession yes failed to score more than 5 points. At the other extreme, New Zealand scored 59-0 versus Japan in match eleven of the Gold COast series with only 108 seconds of possession.

Based on series averages alone we might say that in a typical match a team will have the ball for XYZ seconds and score XYZ points. However, there is a lot of variation around the mean. It is clear that more posssession does not guarantee more points -- or any points at all!

## Possession and winning

The previous section examined the relationship between possession and scoring.
Scoring and winning are different things. Winning does not require scoring a lot of points. It only requires scoring more points than the opponent. And while possession does not necessarily aid in scoring points, it may aid in winning matches by depriving opponents of scoring opportunities. Starving the opponent of possession improves the likelihood of winning is another widely held conventional wisdom about sevens. Put another way, the best defense is a good offense.

This section investigates the relationship between time of possession and scoring differential.

Scorign differential is the difference between the points scored by both teams. For any match the team with the positive scoring differential won. The team with a negative scoring differential lost. Plotting time of possession against scoring differential might visualize the relationship between possession and winning.

### All teams

## Discussion

Time of possession reflects a style of play. Teams can be effective without the ball in hand. This is what we see in other sports. Basketball run and gun systems push the tempo. Ball hawking American football teams that score off turnovers or special teams plays can win without the ball. Therefore, do not force your team to play a possession oriented attack.

The possession statistic only measures ball in play. If we look at bal out of play possession, the numbers may look different. It is possible to control the tempo of a 7s team by taking the maximum time to kick conversions, restart play, kicking for touch and running a lineout play to control the clock. The losing team will push quickly to get the ball back in play. An important area for future study is to measure dead ball possession.

1. Some of the most successful teams do not dominate time of possession
2. Small difference between top time of possession and least. (range)
3. Averages mask what occurs in the individual matches -- but if we look at all matches, we don't see a strong relationship between time of possession and scoring.
4. However, when we look at time of possession and point differential, we see that the teams with a possession advantage only win a little better than half the time.
5. When non-core teams are removed, the results are even closer to 50/50 probability.
6. Therefore there is not very much evidence that time of possession helps a team win as a general rule.

## Summary

One of the problem with using averages is that they often do not depict the typical outcome.

1. Time of possession does is not related to scoring or winning
2. The time of possession differences between the most successful teams and the least are small.
3. Teams with a time of possession advantage only win about 50% of the time.
4. Therefore, time of possession is a better indictator of a style of play than 7s dominance.
5. Because time of possession does not measure dead bsll possession, yet the clock continues to run during a dead ball, it is difficult to see whether total time of possession is a more meaningful statisic.
